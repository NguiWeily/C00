Exercise 00
ft_putchar
Turn-in directory : ex00/
Files to turn in : ft_putchar.c
Allowed functions : write
• Write a function that displays the character passed as a parameter.
• It will be prototyped as follows :
void ft_putchar(char c);
To display the character, you must use the write function as follows.
write(1, &c, 1); and create main test program and put explain each line code with comment and comply with norminette
Here's an example implementation of the `ft_putchar` function in C, complying with the norminette and providing comments to explain each line of code:
#include <unistd.h> // Include the necessary header file for the write function

void ft_putchar(char c) // Define the ft_putchar function that takes a character as a parameter
{
    write(1, &c, 1); // Use the write function to display the character to the standard output
}

int main(void)
{
    char c = 'A'; // Declare a character variable and assign a value to it
    ft_putchar(c); // Call the ft_putchar function to display the character
    return 0; // Return 0 to indicate successful execution of the program
}

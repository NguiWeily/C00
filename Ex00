Files to turn in : ft_putchar.c

Allowed functions : write

• Write a function that displays the character passed as a parameter.

• It will be prototyped as follows :

void ft_putchar(char c);

To display the character, you must use the texttt write function as follows.

write(1, &c, 1);

Based on your instructions, here's an example implementation of the `ft_putchar` function in C:

```c

#include <unistd.h>

void ft_putchar(char c) {

    write(1, &c, 1);

}

```

In this implementation, the function `ft_putchar` takes a character `c` as a parameter and uses the `write` function to display the character. The `write` function writes the character to the standard output (file descriptor 1) by passing the address of `c` and specifying a size of 1.

Please note that this implementation assumes you have included the necessary header file `<unistd.h>` for the `write` function.

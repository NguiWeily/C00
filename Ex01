Files to turn in : ft_print_alphabet.c

Allowed functions : write

• Create a function that displays the alphabet in lowercase, on a single line, by

ascending order, starting from the letter ’a’.

• Here’s how it should be prototyped :

void ft_print_alphabet(void);

Based on your instructions, here's an example implementation of the `ft_print_alphabet` function in C:

```c

#include <unistd.h>

void ft_print_alphabet(void) {

    char c = 'a';

    while (c <= 'z') {

        write(1, &c, 1);

        c++;

    }

    write(1, "\n", 1); // Print a newline character at the end

}

```

In this implementation, the function `ft_print_alphabet` displays the alphabet in lowercase, on a single line, by ascending order, starting from the letter 'a'. It uses a `while` loop to iterate through the characters from 'a' to 'z'. Within the loop, it uses the `write` function to write each character to the standard output (file descriptor 1). After the loop, it writes a newline character (`\n`) to start a new line.

Please note that this implementation assumes you have included the necessary header file `<unistd.h>` for the `write` function.

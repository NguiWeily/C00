Allowed functions : write
• Create a function that displays all digits, on a single line, by ascending order.
• Here’s how it should be prototyped :
void ft_print_numbers(void);


Based on the given instructions, here's an example implementation of the `ft_print_numbers` function in C, using the `write` function to display the digits:

```c

#include <unistd.h>

void ft_print_numbers(void)

{

    char digit = '0';

    while (digit <= '9')

    {

        write(1, &digit, 1);

        digit++;

    }

}

int main()

{

    ft_print_numbers();

    return 0;

}

```

In this code, we include the `<unistd.h>` header to access the `write` function. The `ft_print_numbers` function uses a `while` loop to iterate from `'0'` to `'9'` and writes each digit to the standard output using the `write` function. Finally, we call `ft_print_numbers` from the `main` function to test it.

Please note that the code assumes the standard output file descriptor is `1`. If you are compiling and running this code in a different environment, make sure to adjust the file descriptor accordingly.

You can compile and run this code to see the digits printed on a single line in ascending order.
